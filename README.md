# github-testing
This is a temporary repo for experimenting with github workflow

Commiting changes made on your computer
STEPS
1. git clone ${copied url from github repo}
2. move all files to the automatically generated folder
(don't forget to cd to that directory before continuing^^)
3. git status command: self-explanatory ^^
4. add files you want to commit
   git add index.html
   git add styles.css
   git add index.js
(you can check your status after this to be sure)
5. git commit -m "adding project files"
   this will initialise a git commit (like how you'd do with GUI)
   add -m for commit message
6. git push: for confirming your commit
