# github-testing

This is a repo for experimenting with Github workflow, branching, merging, etc. All uploaded files are "dummy files" apart from the README which serves as a guide for myself until I learn by heart how Github works ^^

Instead of using Github's GUI, I'm trying to get into the habit of using my terminal to commit changes.

COMMITING CHANGES IN TERMINAL

1. git clone {copied url from github repo} => will automatically generate a folder for you to use if you want to make commits from your terminal
2. move all files to the automatically generated folder (don't forget to cd to that directory before continuing^^)
3. git status: self-explanatory ^^
4. add files you want to commit
   git add index.html
   git add styles.css
   git add index.js
   or simply use: git add . (for adding all)
(you can check your status after this to be sure)
5. git commit -m "adding project files"
   this will initialise a git commit (like how you'd do with GUI)
   add -m for commit message
6. git push: for confirming your commit

***EXTRA NOTES***
- with git clone command you can copy everything already existing in the github repo to your computer 
- git commands will not work unless you're in a directory that has a .git in it (obviously)
- git pull: to copy changes to your computer that were uploaded to the repo (updates files on your computer)

BRANCHES/MERGING

- changes shouldn't be made directly to the main branch, instead create a new side branch
- creating a new side branch:
1. git branch: for listing all existing branches
2. git branch {side branch name} for creating a new branch
3. git checkout {side branch name} to switch to the new branch
4. use git push --set-upstream origin ${side branch name} if asked
5. git add {file name}
6. git commit, git push
7. create pull request on github (it pops up as the commit has been made on side branch) that needs to be approved and merged (under Pull requests tab)
8. side branch can be kept or deleted merging

***EXTRA NOTES***
- use git branch -d {branch name} to delete the local branch on your PC
- every now and then do git merge to merge master with your branch so you don't miss out on changes
